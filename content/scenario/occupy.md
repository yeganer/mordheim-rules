This scenario takes place in a part of Mordheim where the buildings are bursting with shards of wyrdstone and other wealth. Taking and holding these buildings means that your warband gains rich pickings. Unfortunately, your opponent has the same idea.
## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
N/A
### Set-up
Each player rolls a D6. The player with the highest score decides which warband sets up first. The first player chooses the table edge he wants to set up on, and places all his warriors within 8" of it. His opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
## Special Rules
The objective is to capture D3+2 of the buildings on the tabletop. Mark these buildings, starting with the one closest to the centre of the table, working your way outwards to the next nearest building. A building is occupied if at least one of your standing models is inside and no enemy models are inside the building.
## Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The player with the higher score takes the first turn.
## Ending the game
There is no need to take any Rout tests â€“ as the game lasts for a maximum of eight turns. If one warband voluntarily routs, the game ends and the winning warband is considered to occupy all of the buildings on the table.
## Experience
__+1 Survives.__ If a Hero or a Henchman group survives they gain +1 Experience.  
__+1 Winning Leader.__ The leader of the warband who controls the highest number of buildings at the end of the battle gains +1 Experience. If both sides occupy the same number of buildings, then the battle is considered to be a draw and neither leader gains this bonus.  
__+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.__ Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
