When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating, warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However, their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone for themselves.

## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.

## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
N/A, although used. A roll-off is suggested. The winner may choose whether they are attacker or defender.
### Set-up
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever scores higher decides which table edge the attacker sets up on.  
The attacker sets up first, within 8" of his table edge. The defender sets up anywhere on the table as long as all his warriors are at least 14" away from any attacker.
## Starting the game
THe attacker has the first turn.

## Ending the game
If one of the warbands fails a Rout test, the game ends immediately and the routing warband loses.  
If the attacker manages to move two or more standing warriors to within 2" of the defenderâ€™s table edge, they have broken through and he wins the game.

## Experience
__+1 Survives.__ If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle, they gain +1 Experience.  
__+1 Winning Leader.__ The leader of the winning warband gains +1 Experience.  
__+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.__ Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.  
__+1 Breaking Through.__ Any warrior earns +1 Experience for breaking through enemy lines. If the warrior is a Henchman, then the whole group gains
+1 Experience.
