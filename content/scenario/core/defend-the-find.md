Often a warband finds a building with a hoard of wyrdstone or other treasure inside, only to be challenged by a rival warband. This usually leads to conflict as it is unlikely that either side will be willing to give up the wealth easily.
## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'. The first building should be placed in the centre of the table, and the objective of the scenario is to take control of this building.
## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
The warband with the lowest number of warriors in it is automatically the defender. If both sides are equal, roll to decide.
### Set-up
The defender is deployed first inside or within 6" of the objective building. The attacking warband is deployed within 6" of any table edge. Note that you can split the warband to enter from different edges if you wish.
## Starting the game
Who has the first turn and in which order does play proceed
## Ending the game
If at the end of the defenderâ€™s turn the attacker has more standing models within 6" of the objective than the defender, the attacker wins.  
Alternatively, when one of the warbands fails its Rout test the game ends.
## Experience
__+1 Survives.__ If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.  
__+1 Winning Leader.__ The leader of the winning warband gains +1 extra Experience.  
__+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.__ Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action.
## Additional stuff
__Wyrdstone.__ One shard of wyrdstone for each Hero of either warband who is inside the objective building at the end of the game (up to a maximum of three shards per warband).
