In the vastness of the Mordheim ruins there is always
the risk of running into a rival warband. While two
groups sometimes pass each other without a fight,
more often than not there is a vicious battle amongst
the ruins. If a warband can drive their rivals away, they
will have a larger area in which to search for
wyrdstone.
## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item.
We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area
roughly 4' x 4'.
## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
N/A
### Set-up
Each player rolls a dice. Whoever rolls highest
chooses who sets up first. The first player then
chooses which table edge to set up on, placing all his
warriors within 8" of that edge. His opponent then
sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
## Special Rules
N/A
## Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The higher scoring player takes
the first turn.
## Ending the game
When one of the warbands fails its Rout test, the game
ends. The routing warband loses and their opponents
win.
## Experience
__+1 Survives.__ If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.

__+1 Winning Leader.__ The leader of the winning warband gains +1 extra Experience.

__+1 Per Enemy Out of Action.__ Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy model he puts out of action
