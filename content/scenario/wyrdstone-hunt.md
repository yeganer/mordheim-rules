Scattered in the ruins of Mordheim are innumerable tiny shards of priceless wyrdstone. It often happens that two warbands come upon the same area and only a battle can determine who will pick the spoils.

In this scenario, warbands encounter each other while scavenging in the same ruined warehouse, vault, temple or other such potentially rich building.
## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
N/A
### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 to see who deploys first. Whoever rolls highest sets up first, within 8" of the table edge of his choice. His opponent then sets up within 8" of the opposite edge.
## Special Rules
Once you have placed the terrain, put some Wyrdstone counters on the tabletop to represent where the shards are. There will be D3+1 counters in total.

Each player takes it in turn to place a counter. Roll a D6 to see which player goes first. The counters must be placed more than 10" from the edge of the table and at least 6" away from each other. Note that counters are placed before deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table. Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table where he fell.

## Starting the game
Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn.
## Ending the game
The game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The routers automatically lose.
