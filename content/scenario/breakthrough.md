When news of a huge deposit of wyrdstone starts circulating, warbands will mount expeditions to unearth the wealth. However, their rivals often try to block them, eager to claim all the wyrdstone for themselves.

## Terrain
Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain,
either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item.
We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area
