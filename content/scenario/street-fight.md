Often two warbands will come face to face with each other in the narrow streets of Mordheim. Sometimes they pass each other without incident but more often the meeting ends in bloodshed.
## Terrain
Set up all the buildings into a single street, with no gaps along the sides. Behind the buildings are impassable ruins, although the buildings themselves are still accessible. The only way out is along the street. The street may be as winding as you like and should not be too narrow to fight in, but can have narrow bottlenecks at some points. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.
## Warbands
### Number of players
2
### Attacker/Defender
N/A
### Set-up
Both players roll a D6 to see who sets up first. Whoever rolls highest chooses whether to deploy first or second. The warbands are deployed within 6" of opposite ends of the street.
## Special Rules
Neither warband can backtrack down the street to leave the battlefield via their own edge.
## Starting the game
Roll a D6 to see who has the first turn.
## Ending the game
When one of the warbands manages to move all its remaining warriors out of the street via the opposing edge, the game ends and that player is victorious.  
Alternatively a warband which fails a Rout test loses the game.
