	"content": "Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves. The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.\nDespite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.\nSpecial Rules  Kindred Hatred The Dark Elves have been fighting the High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves Hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf Hired Swords. Excellent Sight There are numerous legends detailing the excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin. Elves can spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away than normal warriors. (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches) Black Powder Weapons Dark Elves may never use black powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and unreliable. Alignment the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.  Choice of Warriors A Dark Elf warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.\n High Born: Each Dark Elf warband must have one High Born to lead it – no more, no less. Beastmaster: Your warband may include one Beastmaster. Fellblades: Your warband may include up to two Fellblades. Sorceress: Your warband may include one Sorceress. Corsairs: Your warband may include any number of Corsairs. Shades: Your warband may include up to five Shades. Cold One Hounds: Your warband may include up to two hounds if it also includes a Beastmaster.  Beastmaster 50 Gold Crowns to hire Whereas the High Elves have a great affinity with Dragons and Griffons and other noble creatures their malevolent kin have infamous Beastmasters, Dark Elves of particularly cruel renown who breed many vicious beasts and lead them into contact. Unlike the High Elves who treat their beasts as companions, the Dark Elf Beastmasters are very spiteful masters.\nStats for Beastmaster  MWSBSSTWIALd   544331618   Special RulesCold One Beasthound: The Beastmaster may be accompanied by up to two Cold One Beasthounds, these are bought as henchmen and follow all rules for listed for them.\nSkill access: CombatSpeedDark Elf Special Skill  Fellblade 50 Gold Crowns to hire The Fellblades are elite warriors of the Dark Elf armies and are often linked to the household of a particular Noble family. Fellblades live a life of strict martial training, each specialises in a particular weapon and fighting style. Killing is a way of life for these warriors. Enemies can expect no mercy from them. Fellblades accompany raiding parties to Lustria as paid guards or to further hone their killing skills.\nStats for Fellblade  MWSBSSTWIALd   554331618   Special RulesMelee Specialist: Fellblades live by a strict code of close quarter fighting.

They are cold and ruthless killers and they command the respect of their troops through assassination and terror. They have attained their position of leadership by eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their remarkable cunning, they are dangerous foes who embody the merciless traits of the Druchii race.\nStats for High Born  MWSBSSTWIALd   554331619   Special RulesLeader: Any models in the warband within 6\u0026quot; of the High Born may use his Leadership instead of their own.\nSkill access: CombatShootingAcademicSpeedDark Elf Special Skill  Sorceress 70 Gold Crowns to hire Dark Elves are strange in that apart from the fell Witch King there are no other male sorcerers, all the other practitioners of magic in the Dark Elf race are female. It is rumoured that any males who do develop an affinity for magic amongst the Dark Elves are immediately put to death to fulfil some dark prophecy. Dark Elf Sorceresses are mysterious, raven haired beauties who are grudgingly respected even from the powerful High Born and their services are high in demand.\nStats for Sorceress  MWSBSSTWIALd   544331618   Special RulesMagic User: The Dark Elf Sorceress has the ability to use magic and casts spells like any other magicians, and the Dark Elf Sorceress starts with one spells generated at random from the Dark Elf Magic list.

Two rival warbands have heard about the cellar and are now searching the area. Who knows what they will find?\nTerrain Each player takes it in turn to place a piece of terrain, either a ruined building, tower, or other similar item. We suggest that the terrain is set up within an area roughly 4' x 4'.\nWarbands Number of players 2\nAttacker/Defender N/A\nSet-up Both players roll a D6 and whoever rolls highest chooses which warband sets up first. This warband is deployed within 8\u0026quot; of any table edge the player chooses. His opponent sets up within 8\u0026quot; of the opposite side.\nSpecial Rules All the warriors (not animals!) in each warband know roughly what they are looking for and must inspect the buildings to find the treasure. Each time a warrior enters a building which has not been previouslysearched by either side roll 2D6. On a score of 12, he has found the treasure. Buildings in the deployment zones are not searched (since they have already been thoroughly ransacked) and each building may only be searched once.\nIf you have not scored 12 with any roll when there is only one building left to search, the treasure will automatically be found there. After finding the treasure chest, the warrior must then take it to safety via his own table edge. Carrying the treasure chest will slow the warrior carrying it to half speed. Two or more models may carry the chest without any penalty. You may use the treasure chest model to represent the chest. If the carrier is put out of action, place the treasure chest at the spot where he fell. Any man-sized model may pick it up by moving into base contact with it.\nStarting the game Roll a D6. The player rolling highest has the first turn.\nEnding the game When one warband gets the treasure to safety, or a warband fails a Rout test, the game ends. The victorious warband then gains the treasure chest.\nExperience +1 Survives. If a Hero or a Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.\n+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains +1 extra Experience.\n+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy model he puts out of action. +2 For Finding the Chest. If a hero finds the treasure chest he earns +2 Experience.\nAdditional stuff Treasure Chest. Whoever recovers the chest may roll on the following chart after the game to see what the chest contains. Note that you roll for each item separately, apart from the gold crowns, which are always automatically found. For example, roll to see if you find any wyrdstone – you need a 5+ to find it. Then roll to see if you find the armour, and so on. This can make the chest a very valuable acquisition – however, it could also mean that your warband has risked death for only three gold crowns!\n   Items D6 Roll required to find     3D6 Gold Automatic   D3 pieces of Wyrdstone 5+   Suit of light armour 4+   Sword 3+   D3 gems worth 10gc each 5+     "

Note that counters are placed before deciding which edge the warbands will play from, so it is a good idea to put counters towards the middle of the table. Warriors can pick up the counters simply by moving into contact with them. A warrior can carry any amount of wyrdstone without any penalty. Warriors cannot transfer their wyrdstone to another warrior. If the warrior who is carrying a counter is taken out of action, place the counter on the table where he fell.\nStarting the game Both players roll a D6. The highest scoring player takes the first turn.\nEnding the game The game ends when one warband fails its Rout test. The routers automatically lose.\nExperience +1 Survives. If a Hero or Henchman group survives the battle they gain +1 Experience.\n+1 Winning Leader. The leader of the winning warband gains +1 extra Experience.\n+1 Per Enemy Out of Action. Any Hero earns +1 Experience for each enemy he puts out of action. +1 per Wyrdstone Counter. If a Hero or Henchman is carrying a Wyrdstone counter at the end of the battle he receives +1 Experience.\n"
