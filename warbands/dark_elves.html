<h1>Dark Elf Warband</h1>

<p>Dark Ones of Naggaroth Many dare not speak of the High Elves’ evil kin, the Druchii, or the Dark Elves as they are better known. They are a race for whom pain and pleasure have been pushed to the ultimate extreme. They leave destruction and despair in their wake and are more greatly feared than the barbaric Orcs and no less so than the tainted forces of Chaos and Undeath. To the victims of the Dark Elves it is the fortunate to whom a quick death is gifted for this twisted folk roam the Known World in search of slaves. The slaves of the Dark Elves are either worked to death in their mines, ripped apart on the altars to Khaine, their dark God, or tortured mercilessly by the Brides of Khaine, the Witch Elves. Dark Elves take a perverse delight in inflicting pain upon others just to see their victims suffer.</p>
<p>Despite their dire reputation for cruelty they are only rivalled as explorers and adventurers by their High Elven cousins. It is the lure of the precious, arcane artefacts of the Slann that bring these foul creatures to Lustria, travelling stealthily in their Black Arks and penetrating deep into the jungle. Dark Elves are adept at stealth and ambush and are well suited to the overgrown realm of the Lizardmen – most warbands don’t even know they’re being attacked until it is too late.</p>
<h3 id="special-rules">Special Rules</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kindred Hatred</strong>
The Dark Elves have been fighting the High Elves for many centuries. The wars between these two races have been very long and bloody affairs. Dark Elves Hate any High Elf warriors including High Elf Hired Swords.</li>
<li><strong>Excellent Sight</strong>
There are numerous legends detailing the excellent eyesight of the Elves, both Druchii and Ulthuan kin. Elves can spot Hidden enemies from twice as far away than normal warriors. (i.e. twice their Initiative value in inches)</li>
<li><strong>Black Powder Weapons</strong>
Dark Elves may never use black powder weapons as they find them too crude, noisy and unreliable.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment</strong> the Warband’s Alignment is Neutral / Chaotic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="choice-of-warriors">Choice of Warriors</h2>
<p>A Dark Elf warband must include a minimum of three models. You have 500 gold crowns to recruit your initial warband. The maximum number of warriors in the warband may never exceed 12.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Born</strong>: Each Dark Elf warband must have one High Born to lead it – no more, no less.</li>
<li><strong>Beastmaster</strong>: Your warband may include one Beastmaster.</li>
<li><strong>Fellblades</strong>: Your warband may include up to two Fellblades.</li>
<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>: Your warband may include one Sorceress.</li>
<li><strong>Corsairs</strong>: Your warband may include any number of Corsairs.</li>
<li><strong>Shades</strong>: Your warband may include up to five Shades.</li>
<li><strong>Cold One Hounds</strong>: Your warband may include up to two hounds if it also includes a Beastmaster.</li>
</ul>

      <div >
        <h3>Beastmaster</h3>
        <strong>50</strong> Gold Crowns to hire
        <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">Whereas the High Elves have a great affinity with Dragons and Griffons and other noble creatures their malevolent kin have infamous Beastmasters, Dark Elves of particularly cruel renown who breed many vicious beasts and lead them into contact. Unlike the High Elves who treat their beasts as companions, the Dark Elf Beastmasters are very spiteful masters.</p>

        <h3>Fellblade</h3>
        <strong>50</strong> Gold Crowns to hire
        <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">The Fellblades are elite warriors of the Dark Elf armies and are often linked to the household of a particular Noble family. Fellblades live a life of strict martial training, each specialises in a particular weapon and fighting style. Killing is a way of life for these warriors. Enemies can expect no mercy from them. Fellblades accompany raiding parties to Lustria as paid guards or to further hone their killing skills.</p>

        <h3>High Born</h3>
        <strong>80</strong> Gold Crowns to hire
        <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">Dark Elf Leaders are typically drawn from the Dark Elf nobility and lead the warband in search of gold,
slaves and arcane artefacts to bring home to Naggaroth. They are cold and ruthless killers and they command
the respect of their troops through assassination and terror. They have attained their position of leadership
by eliminating rival nobles who stand in their way and through their remarkable cunning, they are dangerous
foes who embody the merciless traits of the Druchii race.</p>

        <h3>Sorceress</h3>
        <strong>70</strong> Gold Crowns to hire
        <p class="font-weight-light font-italic">Dark Elves are strange in that apart from the fell Witch King there are no other male sorcerers, all the other practitioners of magic in the Dark Elf race are female. It is rumoured that any males who do develop an affinity for magic amongst the Dark Elves are immediately put to death to fulfil some dark prophecy. Dark Elf Sorceresses are mysterious, raven haired beauties who are grudgingly respected even from the powerful High Born and their services are high in demand.</p>

The Dark Elves are as accomplished practitioners of magic as their arch enemies the High Elves but whereas the High Elves essentially use magic defensively and for the power of good, the Dark Elves utilise the evil powers of Dark Magic a very destructive force indeed.
