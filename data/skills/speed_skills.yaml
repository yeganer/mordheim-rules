    - name: Leap
      fluff: 
      prerequisite: 
      description: The warrior may leap D6" in the movement phase in addition to his normal movement. He may move and leap, run and leap, or charge and leap, but he can only leap once per turn. A leaping warrior may jump over opposing man-sized models, including enemies, and obstacles 1" high, without penalty. The leap may also be used to leap over gaps, but in this case you must commit the warrior to making the leap before rolling the dice to see how far he jumps. If he fails to make it all the way across, he falls through the gap.

    - name: Acrobat
      fluff: The warrior is incredibly supple and agile.
      prerequisite: 
      description: He may fall or jump from a height of up to 12" without taking any damage if he passes a single Initiative test, and can re-roll failed Diving Charge rolls. He can still only make a diving charge from a height of up to 6".

    - name: Jump Up
      fluff: The warrior can regain his footing in an instant, springing to his feet immediately if he is Knocked Down.

      prerequisite: 
      description: He can avoid any hits from a missile weapon on a D6 roll of 5+.
