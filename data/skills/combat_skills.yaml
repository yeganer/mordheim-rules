      prerequisite: 
      description: The warrior may opt to forego his normal attacks and make a single sweep attack against all the models in base to base contact with him instead of making his normal attacks. Rather than rolling to hit, each foe has to pass an Initiative test to avoid the blow.

If successful the opponent must fight without the designated weapon until he recovers it. The foe recovers his weapon in the first Recovery Phase out of hand-to-hand combat. Not vs. natural weaponry.

If the model, with Mob Mentality, is taken out of action while giving bonuses, then all models who are benefiting from the effects will automatically fail an “All alone check” and move accordingly.
