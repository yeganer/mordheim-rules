Ithilmar_Weapons:
 name: Ithilmar Weapons 
 fluff: Elven blades are forged from priceless Ithilmar, an extremely light but strong metal, found only in the fabled Elven kingdoms. A few of these weapons are occasionally found in the Old World and these are normally spoils of war, taken by the Norse raiders who pillage the coastal settlements of the Elves.
 price: Melee Weapon price x3 
 rarity: Rare 9
 effect: Strikes with an Ithilmar Weapon are dealt at +1I. Note that this can lead to a model striking at two initiative Steps. This may not lead to a model injuring an enemy and finishing him off right away. The model being attacked is always fought the way it was at the beginning of the attacking model's strikes.

Obsidian_Weapons: 
 name: Obsidian Weapons 
 fluff: Obsidian is mined in the Dark Lands by the minions of Chaos. When expertly derived from its ore, the curious volcanic rock becomes ensorcelled by engineers manufacturing artefacts in the furnaces of Zharr-Naggrund. Forging weapons using these vile techniques requires acute diabolic expertise making them extremely rare.
 price: Melee Weapon price x4 
 rarity: Rare 12
 effect: 
   - Grants the weapon an additional modifier of +1S. Note that this may stack with existing modifiers. 
   - Grants the weapon the strike last rule. The weight of this weapon makes its user strike last in combat, even when charging. Learning the strongman skill negates this effect. 
   - When a critical hit is scored with an obsidian weapon, roll an additional die. On a 1-2 the weapon breaks and may not be used for the remainder of the battle.
